# retroid-pocket-classic-bezels

Some custom bezels I made for my Retroid Pocket Classic.

If you want to use the "GBC_1x1_V3" one for GB/GBC, you should apply these video steps:

In Retroarch, go to Settings > Video > Scalling:

- Turn "Integer Scaling" off.
- Set "Aspect Ratio" to "Custom"
- Set "Custom Aspect Ratio (Y Position)" to 0
- Set "Custom Aspect Ratio (Y Position)" to 35
- Set "Custom Aspect Ratio (Width)" to "1120 (7x)"
- Set "Custom Aspect Ratio (Height)" to "1008 (7x)"

Also, make sure to have "Auto-Scale Overlay" disabled in the "On-Screen Overlay" settings.
